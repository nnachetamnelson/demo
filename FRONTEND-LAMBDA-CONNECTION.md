# Frontend → Lambda Connection - FIXED ✅

## ❌ **The Problem:**

Your frontend was trying to connect to:
```
http://localhost:4000  ← Nothing running here!
```

But your Lambda backend is running on:
```
http://localhost:8080  ← Lambda container here!
```

Result: **Network Error** ❌

---

## ✅ **The Fix:**

Created `frontend/.env.local`:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080
```

This tells the frontend to connect to your Lambda container.

---

## 🔄 **Restart Frontend (Required):**

### **Option 1: In the frontend PowerShell window**
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

### **Option 2: Start fresh from main terminal**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 **Test After Restart:**

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Login with**:
   - Email: `admin@school.com`
   - Password: `AdminPass123!`
   - Tenant ID: `school1`

3. **Watch Lambda logs** (in another terminal):
   ```powershell
   docker logs lambda-test-debug -f
   ```

You should see:
```
info: Unified request: POST /api/auth/login
info: User login attempt...
```

---

## 🎯 **What's Running:**

```
✅ Lambda Backend:  http://localhost:8080 (Docker)
✅ Frontend:        http://localhost:5173 (needs restart)
✅ PostgreSQL:      host.docker.internal:5432
```

---

## 🔍 **Verify Connection:**

After restarting frontend:

### In Browser DevTools (F12 → Network):
You should see API calls to:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login
http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register
```

### In Lambda Logs:
```powershell
docker logs lambda-test-debug -f
```

You should see incoming requests from frontend.

## ✅ **Success Checklist:**

- [x] Lambda backend running on port 8080
- [x] `frontend/.env.local` created
- [ ] Frontend restarted (YOU NEED TO DO THIS)
- [ ] Tested login from browser
- [ ] Seeing requests in Lambda logs

---

## 🚀 **Once Working:**

This proves your Lambda backend works perfectly with the frontend!

When deployed to AWS:
- Frontend (CloudFront): https://your-cloudfront-url.com
- Backend (Lambda): https://your-lambda-url.amazonaws.com

The Terraform `frontend.tf` will automatically configure the production API URL.

**Restart your frontend and try logging in again!** 🎉
